# Pizza-Sales-Analysis

### Project Overview
This project provides an analysis of Linda Pizza's sales data and offers actionable insights for Dford's partnership. The analysis aims to help Dford optimize its supply chain, improve product delivery, and enhance its role as a strategic partner in Linda Pizza’s growth.

### Executive Summary
This analysis highlights Linda Pizza’s strong sales performance and provides actionable insights to support its growth. With a total of 49,574 orders and £801,945 in revenue, the most popular pizzas include big_meat_s, thai_chick_l, and five_cheese_l, showcasing a mix of traditional and specialty flavors. Larger pizza sizes (XL, XXL) and premium offerings like The Greek Pizza present high-revenue opportunities.
